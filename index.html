                    <p>My name is Lauri Loikkanen and I'm a 25-year-old UX designer from Espoo, Finland. I'm also a master's student at Aalto University, where I study Information Networks with a major in User-Centered Design.</p>
                    <p>My studies have basically consisted of three elements - information technology, industrial management and social studies. During my bachelor's degree I took courses ranging from Java and XML programming to work psychology, and from concept design to digital media. However, my master's phase has mostly revolved around User-Centered Design, and has included several intensive design-related courses with a variety of interesting projects, some of which were targeted for actual Finnish companies.</p>
                    <p>Professionally, I have worked as a UX/UI designer for a few years now, performing various design-related tasks, such as conducting user research and designing interactive UI prototypes. My main professional motivation is to design digital services with the best possible user experience, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge of the subject. Although my work experience so far has mostly focused on UX design, I'm keen to learn more about visual design and service design as well.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy good food and music - I also play the guitar and sometimes perform with my band. My other hobbies include going to the gym, jogging... or sometimes even climbing mountains, such as the Balinese volcano in the background picture!</p>

                            <p>This course was an intensive 6 month project, that basically covered all the aspects of user-centered design. The general theme provided for the project was Mobility as a Service, and each group were to select a target user group of their choice. Our group decided to design a service for tourists, so the work began by interviewing tourists in Helsinki and finding out what kind of mobility-related needs would they have.
                            </p>
                            <p>Eventually after rounds of iteration and prototyping, we found that the tourists were missing a simple navigation app, that instead of showing the shortest route between two places, would provide the user with the most interesting route, based on the user preferences. The final phases of the project were essentially about refining and testing the digital prototype, for which we used a software called JustInMind. In addition to the design-related activities, an important part of the course were the weekly pitches, where each member got to present the group's progress.</p>

                            <p>The focal point of this course was a group assignment, where a thorough usability analysis and evaluation of a client's product was performed. Our group's case was OmaMehiläinen, a mobile application provided by the Finnish healthcare company Mehiläinen.
                            </p>
                            <p>The evaluation consisted of a series of observations and interviews at the client's premises, where the application was tested by several customers of Mehiläinen. In addition, our group performed a heuristic evaluation and a cognitive walkthrough on the application.
                            </p>
                            <p>Although I was already familiar with various methods of usability evaluation, this course definitely enhanced my knowledge on the subject. I also thought that the case was also particularly interesting.</p>

                            <p>This course featured an intensive 2 month project where the Lean Service Creation model (a user-centric model developed by Finnish company Futurice) was applied in practice to solve a problem for a selected client. The case of my group was particularly interesting, as our task was to come up with a concept that would serve as the basis for another Aalto course, Social Media. We had relatively little constraints in what the concept would be, but the idea was to build something that would give a voice to the students at the campus and improve the overall community-experience. Simultaneously it was important to ensure that our concept would provide weekly assignments for the students of the Social Media course.
                            </p>
                            <p>After a series of interviews and discussions with our client, and plenty of iteration, we finally came up with a concept called Aalto Talks, which was a social media -based platform that in a way resembled a talk show. The students of the Social Media course would each get to participate in the making of the show, which would then be broadcasted online for the whole community.
                            </p>
                            <p>The course taught a lot about how to refine what is initially a vague concept idea into something that is useful to both the client and the end-users of a service. The methods of Lean Service Creation turned out to be helpful in such a fast-paced project.</p>

                            <p>This course was mainly about conducting user research. The focal point was a group assignment where the customer journey of a selected brick-and-mortar store was analyzed. The data collection consisted of on-site observation, customer interviews and a web survey. After the data was analyzed, a suggested solution that would enhance the store's customer experience was presented to the store managers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>What I especially learned from this course was how complicated a customer journey might be, even if the provided service isn't that complicated at a first glance. Furthermore, this course taught me how to conduct extensive user research in practice. This knowledge has turned out to be quite useful in my working life as well.

                            <p>The focus of this course was not particularly in UI design, but instead creating a concept for a social
                            media service and analyzing the societal factors that affect it - such as legislation, political factors,
                            cultural norms etc.</p>
                            <p>
                            Our group of 4 students came up with a service called EasyHousing, a web service that acts as a meeting place between people who are in desperate need for urgent accommodation (such as exchange students) and those who can rent their room or a whole apartment for other people. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I thought the course was extremely educating as it showed that there's much more to designing a social media service than good UI or technical details. Basically it taught me how to think of a problem first from all the possible angles before jumping into the solution straight away. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Even though UI design was not a main goal in this course, I designed a few simple UI mockups to visualize the content of the service.</p>

                            which could be used for usability testing. </p>

                            The topic of our group assignment was an electronic newsletter application for a community
                            in a developing country.
                            The tricky part was that the application should be usable with no internet connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our solution was the Paperboy App - an Internet-free application where the user could read,
                            write and share news using his device's bluetooth connection. We did this assignment in a 
                            group of 4 people - starting with paper prototypes and then using Axure RP to generate
                            interactive hi-fi UI protos. We did separate UI prototypes for mobile, tablet and desktop versions.

                            <img src="img/portfolio/soundchat.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The objective of this course was to come up with a concept for a web service, design and develop it. 
                                Our group of 3 students came up with SoundChat - a simple chat service for music fans (and artists), where as a special feature the users could share songs from SoundCloud. After copying and pasting a URL from a SoundCloud song to the chat's text field and pressing enter, the song would appear as a SoundCloud-track that could be played directly while in the chatroom. 
                            </p>
                            <p>To make the service a bit more diverse, in the front page there were multiple chatrooms named after musical genres, so the user would find interesting music from the genre that he/she likes.
                            </p>
                            <p>This course was a bit challenging, as it required a lot of work for only three people, and included all the phases from creating a web service, from coming up with the idea to back-end developing. However,
                            I found it useful, as it made me consider the relations between all the phases in generating a fully functional web service.</p>

                            <p>The focus of this course was to experiment with different types of multimodal interfaces. Some exercises were done in groups of 4 students, while others were done individually. In all of the exercises, the programming language used was Processing.</p>
                            <p>The first group exercise was to come up with a way to visualize information in a multimodal interface. The information our group decided to visualize was the booking fees of various well known artists, whereas our solution to the multimodal aspect was to utilize speech recognition. The user would use his computer's microphone to say out loud the name of an artist. With Google's Speech Recognition API the program would then recognize the artist, search it from the database and visualize in a simple bar chart and textbox the information about the booking fee for that particular artist.</p>
                            <p>In the second group exercise, we created a Nintendo Wii -style Star Wars game, where the user would wave an actual (toy) lightsaber, while a "Jedi Training Ball" (as seen in Star Wars IV) would shoot laser beams constantly. With Kinect, the program would detect the user's movements and the position of the lightsaber.
                            </p>
                            <p>I found this course particularly interesting, since it demonstrated the many ways to create programs and games, with using something else than keyboard and mouse. Also I found Processing to be quite a simple programming language, although its capabilities are limited compared to more complicated languages, such as Java.</p>
