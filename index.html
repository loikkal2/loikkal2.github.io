                    <p>TEST TEST My name is Lauri Loikkanen and I'm a 23 years old student from Espoo, Finland. I study Information Networks at Aalto University, majoring in Media.</p>
                    <p>My studies basically consist of three elements - information technology, industrial management and social studies. During the past years 
                    I have passed courses ranging from Java and XML programming to work psychology and from user-centric design to digital media.</p>
                    <p>However, what most interests me is usability and user experience. As an active user of web services and applications I have encountered too many web services or mobile apps with poor usability and chaotic user interfaces. Therefore I have high motivation in working in a field where I can do something about it.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy good food and music - I also play the guitar and sometimes perform with my band. My other hobbies include going to the gym, jogging... or sometimes even climbing mountains, such as the Balinese volcano in the background picture!</p>

                            <p>The focus of this course was not particularly in UI design, but instead creating a concept for a social
                            media service and analyzing the societal factors that affect it - such as legislation, political factors,
                            cultural norms etc.</p>
                            <p>
                            Our group of 4 students came up with a service called EasyHousing, a web service that acts as a meeting place between people who are in desperate need for urgent accommodation (such as exchange students) and those who can rent their room or a whole apartment for other people. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I thought the course was extremely educating as it showed that there's much more to designing a social media service than good UI or technical details. Basically it taught me how to think of a problem first from all the possible angles before jumping into the solution straight away. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Even though UI design was not a main goal in this course, I designed a few simple UI mockups to visualize the content of the service.</p>

                            The focus of this course was to design and develop an interactive user interface prototype
                            which could be used for usability testing. </p>
                            <p>
                            The topic of our group assignment was an electronic newsletter application for a community
                            in a developing country.
                            The tricky part was that the application should be usable with no internet connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our solution was the Paperboy App - an Internet-free application where the user could read,
                            write and share news using his device's bluetooth connection. We did this assignment in a 
                            group of 4 people - starting with paper prototypes and then using Axure RP to generate
                            interactive hi-fi UI protos. We did separate UI prototypes for mobile, tablet and desktop versions.

                            <p>The objective of this course was to come up with a concept for a web service, design and develop it. 
                                Our group of 3 students came up with SoundChat - a simple chat service for music fans (and artists), where as a special feature the users could share songs from SoundCloud. After copying and pasting a URL from a SoundCloud song to the chat's text field and pressing enter, the song would appear as a SoundCloud-track that could be played directly while in the chatroom. 
                            </p>
                            <p>To make the service a bit more diverse, in the front page there were multiple chatrooms named after musical genres, so the user would find interesting music from the genre that he/she likes.
                            </p>
                            <p>This course was a bit challenging, as it required a lot of work for only three people, and included all the phases from creating a web service, from coming up with the idea to back-end developing. However,
                            I found it useful, as it made me consider the relations between all the phases in generating a fully functional web service.</p>

                            <p>The focus of this course was to experiment with different types of multimodal interfaces. Some exercises were done in groups of 4 students, while others were done individually. In all of the exercises, the programming language used was Processing.</p>
                            <p>The first group exercise was to come up with a way to visualize information in a multimodal interface. The information our group decided to visualize was the booking fees of various well known artists, whereas our solution to the multimodal aspect was to utilize speech recognition. The user would use his computer's microphone to say out loud the name of an artist. With Google's Speech Recognition API the program would then recognize the artist, search it from the database and visualize in a simple bar chart and textbox the information about the booking fee for that particular artist.</p>
                            <p>In the second group exercise, we created a Nintendo Wii -style Star Wars game, where the user would wave an actual (toy) lightsaber, while a "Jedi Training Ball" (as seen in Star Wars IV) would shoot laser beams constantly. With Kinect, the program would detect the user's movements and the position of the lightsaber.
                            </p>
                            <p>I found this course particularly interesting, since it demonstrated the many ways to create programs and games, with using something else than keyboard and mouse. Also I found Processing to be quite a simple programming language, although its capabilities are limited compared to more complicated languages, such as Java.</p>
